# Littoral
### Boilerplate theme and routes

This is a bare bones setup for the Littoral demo server.

### Installation.

As the user you are running the Littoral application under. Clone this repo into ~/.littoral

```shell 
$ git clone https://github.com/PaperElectron/littoral-boilerplate.git ~/.littoral
```

If you plan on tracking your changes with git, you can either fork this project and follow the instructions above, or delete the .git directory inside and recreate it to point to your own private repo somewhere.
